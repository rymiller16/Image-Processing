To run the morphing script, simply run the script (which calls another script for formatting) and pick your options. Note, the current "morp params" json file
is set up to run the spongebob example. See the report for the other results that are better representations of the algorithm. There is not input 
for the parameter "t" and must be changed by altering the code near the bottom of the script. 

To run the atlas script, simply run the script (it also calls a formatting script to read in the json file). The current "atlas params" json file 
is set up to run the brain data. 

All data used can be found in its respective folders. To be able to run the script, you must take the files out of the folders and place them in the same
directory as the scripts and json files or else the python scripts will not be able to find the input images.
