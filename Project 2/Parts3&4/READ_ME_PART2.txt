Neural Networks: 

5 different neural networks are provided in the models folder. Each network needs the testing and training dataset folders (although these are not uploaded
as instructed in the assignment submission) because the model trains on the training dataset and tests on the testing dataset as well as 
plotting 5 testing set images after being passed through the model. Each model also tests out a non-testing/training set image, included in this folder, 
titled "Jerry". Enjoy the models. Results are in the results folder. 

P.S. Model 3 is the best. Models 4 and 5 are terrible. Models 1 and 2 are decent.
